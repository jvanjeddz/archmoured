# archmoured

It arises from the idea of documenting the installation of my current Arch install with the purpose of deeply understanding everything I ~~plagiarized~~ did in order to obtain such a solid system. As there are almost no up-to-date instructions for this 
specific setup, I decided to share it on the internet in extreme detail so that anyone can replicate it and understand it as well.

This site employs [Github actions](https://github.com/features/actions) with the purpose of 
[deploying to neocities](https://github.com/bcomnes/deploy-to-neocities).

Archmoured was made with [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).
